## change-log


### 2019.04.11
1. I set up this project as a repository here.
2. I did not figure out why the output of my test cases is
different from those of the authors.


### 2019.04.13
1. I have double checked the code and the tutorial but still 
did not figure out why the difference of the test cases. On the
other hand, I doubted that the output of the test cases posted
by the author was not correct...
2. I have updated the code so that the demonstration is more clear.
3. The next step is to use a bigger dataset instead of the current
one with size only **5k**, in order to meet the requirement of "big data".
4. There are also some potential improvement idea of this project provided
by the author. We can think about it later.


### 2019.04.25
1. I have upated the code in order to save the figures for the convenience of visualization;

### Note:
1. If you run the program and get some warnings at the beginning saying
"RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary 
incompatibility. Expected 96, got 80"

**Just reinstall numpy(1.15.1 or above) as below**
